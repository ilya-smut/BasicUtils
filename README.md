# Helper Utils

Welcome to the Helper Utils repository! This repository is a collection of different utilities developed to automate and simplify routine processes in your everyday coding life.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository and import the necessary functions from the modules. Functions are organized by their use-case, making it easy to find the utility you need.

## Utilities

Currently, the repository includes utilities for encoding and decoding text. Here are some examples:

### Encoding and Decoding Utilities

The `encoder.py` module provides functions for base64 and URL encoding and decoding:

- `b64_e(text)`: This function takes a string as an argument and returns the base64 encoded version of the string.
- `b64_d(text)`: This function takes a base64 encoded string as an argument and returns the original string.
- `url_e(text)`: This function takes a string as an argument and returns the URL encoded version of the string.
- `url_d(text)`: This function takes a URL encoded string as an argument and returns the original string.

## Future Improvements

While the repository currently only contains encoding and decoding utilities, we plan to add more utilities for different purposes soon.

Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute!
